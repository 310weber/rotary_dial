Source code compiled with AVR Studio v4.18 + WinAVR for attiny45, optimization -O1.

SUT_CKSEL fuse should be programmed for external 4 Mhz crystal oscillator.


-- WARNING --
SETTING RSTDISBL TO ENABLED WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PROGRAM THE CHIP WITH NORMAL METHODS - YOU WILL NEED A HIGH VOLTAGE PROGRAMMER TO RESET THE FUSES
-- WARNING --

Low Fuse = 0xCD
High Fuse = 0x5F
Extended = 0xFF

 - Clock = Ext. Crystal, 3-8 MHz, 1 CK / 14 CK + 65 ms
 - CKDIV8 = disabled (use full 4 MHz speed)
 - RSTDISBL = enabled (use PB5 as I/O)

The converter originally designed to be mounted/wired inside the phone. 
It has to be connected in parallel to the phone line, but _after_ the hook switch, e.g. between terminals C and F/RR on the phone schematic. 
Rotary dial (all 4 wires) has to be disconnected from the phone and wired to the adapter (see schematic). 
The adapter is polarity sensitive.
Terminal C is just a solder pad, so I ended up using L2 instead (itï¿½s a nice screw terminal).
